# Change Log

## !Deploy

* [Feature] `Copy-FileHash` now has a `-Mirror` parameter that can be used to remove any files from the Destination folder that are not in the Source path ([#5](https://github.com/markwragg/PowerShell-HashCopy/issues/5)). This has had limited testing so use with caution, always check `-WhatIf` first.

## [1.0.54] - 2020-02-21

* [Feature] `Copy-FileHash` can now accept an array of file paths rather than just directory paths. Thanks [@Marc05](https://github.com/Marc05)!

## [1.0.53] - 2019-09-09

* Testing new deployment pipeline.
